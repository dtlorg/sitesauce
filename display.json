Organs you can donate include:  Internal organs: Kidneys, heart, liver, pancreas, intestines, lungs Skin Bone and bone marrow Cornea Most organ and tissue donations occur after the donor has died. But some organs and tissues can be donated while the donor is alive.  People of all ages and background can be organ donors. If you are under age 18, your parent or guardian must give you permission to become a donor. If you are 18 or older you can show you want to be a donor by signing a donor card. You should also let your family know your wishes.",

		"desc": "In our cars, stores, banks, and homes, smart technologies are already a part of our daily lives. On a daily basis, we come into contact with intelligent settings. Despite this, many universities continue to maintain siloed infrastructures that don't serve or connect with anyone other than their connected stakeholders. There are a number of software platforms and enormous ERP/SIS systems that do not communicate with one another. Consider a different type of infrastructure: one that intelligently communicated to assure positive results in every encounter and event. Our goal is to use technology wherever possible and make tasks done by the colleges/universities easier, smarter and much more faster.",
