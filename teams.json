But some organs and tissues can be donated while the donor is alive.  People of all ages and background can be organ donors. If you are under age 18, your parent or guardian must give you permission to become a donor. If you are 18 or older you can show you want to be a donor by signing a donor card. You should also let your family know your wishes."

We understood that 1 in every 5 adults experiences some sort of mental health issue and 1 in every 25 adults has severe effects on how they function daily. Then we went about interviewing ourselves and jotting down all the issues we faced in the past few years and how we reacted to them. Then we went on to interview a few people to get a vague idea about the situation in the general public. We then created a form to take a survey among the larger group of people and the results we got from the survey helped us to come to a general idea that about 40% of the people who are not comfortable in life are facing some sort of mental health issues and almost 80% of them didn't seek any professional help"

We filtered out some of them and chose the reason which was convenient to us, to work on it and chose ,toys from waste as a possibility to bring the change that is in our catch. As we researched, we got know that, dry waste can be used or molded into toys when worked on it. Cardboards, thermacols, used tins, some of the plastic wastes etc has been used to built toys. We could gather a lot of knowledge on wastes being produced in our country and all over the world. We got to know that, there are different types of wastes and has a large impact on the environment when left unconcerned. Flowcharts, google forms etc were made in order to get a clear point of view on what can be done by us to bring a change. It was fun making and we tried our best in achieving so."

Through rescue and education, Hope For Paws works to raise awareness for abandoned animals.Dogs are man\u2019s best friend for a reason. Humans and dogs have shared a special bond for centuries. These friendly pups help us reduce anxiety and tension and love us with all they have. While we give sweet and comforting hugs to our pets, there are some poor pups who live on the streets and are often deprived of all the warmth and affection. We sometimes feel anxious and sad for these helpless dogs on streets in rough weather conditions and with poor health issues. This made up to take up on this mission for the betterment of strays .We are actively conducting the surveys regarding the difficulties faced by the strays . We initially conducted a survey regarding the condition of stray dogs and the results were not too encouraging. We are also observing an active participation of people along with us to take the mission forward .  We are also glad to inform that around 20 volunteers joined us to help in improving the life of strays.  We are trying to contact several sponsors for funding as well. We fed around 50 dogs since we took up this mission.  The dogs we feed today are in good and healthy shape, we are even thinking about creating a platform for adoption.We are a group of seven friends with a vision  who got moved by the condition of stray animals during these covid times as they were unable to find food. Many studies also show that the percentage increase of stray animals is very high over the last couple of years. By observing all these we decided to take up this mission in helping the stray animals to make sure they find food and shelter."

What we were able to sense uptill now is that its not just that people are unaware of the need to manage waste but there are certain more important things that are holding them back to do so such as the amount of personal investment of money they need to make in order to segregate waste. But we can also say that there is a lot of unawareness, among the people or the organisations addressing this issue about efficient ways to manage waste. As this project onsets us on our journey to explore the cause(s), we want to give it out best to understand and come up with it, as only after we are able to uncover the cause(es) it would be easy for anyone to come-up with solutions."

For example, one may be needing an item under urgency, one would definitely then prefer going to a store that's within a walkable distance over ordering it online that might take 2-3 days to arrive. Not just this, online shopping for groceries can also be more expensive at times depending on the demand and delivery charges. Good packaging and quality of products ordered online may also not be assured. In case one's looking for perishable items like milk and curd, or even fresh fruits and vegetables on a daily basis, one has no other choice but to go to a nearby grocery store!"

But this has also led to an increase in the negative impacts of development like pollution, water depletion, etc. and one such issue that has arised (mainly in the urban households) is food wastage. People are buying more than they consume and are taking the food they\u2019re eating for granted. Moreover, this food which turns into waste can be put into good use by feeding the people in need, just by eating consciously( knowing what and how much a person can eat ). We think we can bring a change in the thought process of people by just helping them realise the efforts and the resources that have been put in the making of these, and how it could\u2019ve been put to good use. This realisation can, we believe, drastically lower the amount of food that will be wasted. Also, because of technological advancements, the food which is inevitably wasted, is also being used to generate power. We think a proper supply-chain/system put in place which facilitates the transport of the waste to these companies can also help, as this food waste release harmful emissions and cause pollution. We are also trying to come up with a way to work with the orphanages so that this healthy food is not actually wasted. Though we are still working on more ideas, we think this will only work with the combined effort of all the people. "

Rules to the Game of Marbles you can see a white circle on the board. Marbles are placed inside the circle, usually near the center. Taking a Turn  The player uses their shooter marble to take a turn. To shoot the marble typically a player will use their thumb to flick the marble from their hand putting their \"knuckles down\" onto the ground. The goal of each shot is to hit one of the marbles in the center and knock it out of the circle. If the player knocks a marble out, then they get to keep the marble for the rest of the game, they also get to take another turn. If no marble is knocked out of the circle, the other player then gets a turn then next shot can be taken from the spot where the shooter landed. Winning in Marbles  The player with the most marbles at the end of the game is the winner. Other options/rules:  If a player knocks the other player's shooter from the circle, then the shooter wins all the player's marbles they have won so far and that player is out of the game."

It is a structure that was built to produce civil servants, clerks and bureaucrats who could do the routine job. Not much has changed in the objective of our education system, even today. Now we have engineers being produced in bulk creating imbalance in the demand and supply in the job market. The same old rote learning mentality of students to score the highest marks, holds priority not only for the students but their guiding angels (parents and teachers). There is a thin line drawn between an educated and talented individual. Anyone with a first class degree is preferred over a hardworking and talented student, who scores in an average slot."

Throughout the epidemic, which caused widespread mental pain and anxiety, schools and universities across the country had just one goal: to finish exams and submit all assignments on time. We had schools informing us that our tests and grades were still the most important things throughout what was without a doubt a time when everyone's mental health, especially students', worsened. There were no concessions or offers of assistance. The establishment claimed to be oblivious to students' problems all around the country. What should have been a lesson on mental health and empathy became something that reinforced the idea of life being short."

The device we use to convert that solar resource into usable electricity is a photovoltaic cell or simply, a solar cell. The solar cell, however, comes with limitations The average industrial efficiency of a solar panel is 15-20 percent. This means only about 15 to 20 percent of the energy received from the sun is being converted into electricity. Increasing the efficiency of solar panels is all our project is about. We employ non-invasive upgrades on solar cells/panels so that they give more net output and thus raising their total average efficiency."

We created \"HyTour\" to make this happen. HyTour is the most effective way to simplify tourism. Not only do we provide the history and basic information, but we also recommend the best times and people to accompany you on your tour. It's not just a standard website with recommendations and information on locations to visit in Hyderabad; it's also a blog where people can explore and express their experiences there. So that you can not only hear other people's opinions, but also ask questions and get them answered.  We created HyTour with the goal of ensuring that everyone, whether a local or a visitor, may enjoy their visit without difficulty."

Elaborate model for onboarding new tutors onto the platform, mostly students looking for an internship alternative/ gain experience in skills they may already have acquired. As a tutor provides more tuitions, his/her reviews and ratings keep increasing. This enables the students to narrow down the best tutors. We cater to national audience, with students ranging from pre-primary to secondary schools, or even entrance preps. Working like a match maker between the tutors and students both being the young generation of the society. Only one other startup is somewhat close to the idea of our model, called  FlipClass . But this startup model is restricted by the means of appointing tutors as it accepts only 9/100 applications. Our model is open to all students that want to teach and earn and as we focus on pre primary to secondary edu, we follow a sort of pyramid theme where for eg. 12th grader can tutor a fifth grader i.e  the knowledge gap is big enough to ensure the tutor can and will be successful in his/her job. The student/their guardian and the tutor can negotiate one on one through a chat bot or direct communication and some percent of the total pay comes to as commission to the startup. Payment would be on a monthly/ half yearly basis. This type of model might face situations where once a tutor is matched with a student, they might start further external communication in order to avoid commission payment and to curb these type of problems we came up with an internship/experience certificate that is granted to tutors only if they provide tuitions through the startup and over a specific period of time say a year or two depending on the subject or course they teach."

All though i had some challenges to face while working with the group it was fun to overcome those hardships and it was the best experience I'd ever had. Our initiative was motivated by the emotion felt by many people and which has been a developing problem in the young generation; Lonliness. Over a span of 4 weeks my groupmates and myself have tried to discern and distinguish about this feeling which causes the person discomfort and a sense of unhappiness. We have been surveying various groups and sectors of people, some of them i personally found really distressing. The voulunteers we had interviewed had tried their best to put their emotions into words and expressed their issues both physiologically and psychologically. We conducted a poll and found out majority of those who were lonely were between the ages of 18 to 40. In the end, i would like to say that the project we worked on had given me a chance to participate and made me aware of the daily life of ceratin individuals while helping me to overcome these circumstances myself and gain an understanding on this subject."
